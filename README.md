#Are the summers in San Francisco really cooler?

> The coldest winter I ever spent was a summer in San Francisco.
> --- Mark Twain*

Mark Twain probably didn't write that - but it has always stayed in the imagination of anyone who has lived in San Francisco and worn jackets and scarves during July while their friends and families elsewhere are barbequeing and swimming.

I was once told that the cool summer weather in SF (and especially the famous late afternoon fog) was due to the warmer weather in the interior of California.  I wanted to examine whether this was true or not, looking at weather data from Walnut Creek, a town inland enough to have much hotter weather than San Francisco, and from SF itself. 

By downloading several years of weather data from Weather Underground and analyzing it, I was able to satisfy my curiosity - the daily range of temperature in SF had a correlation to the high temperatures in Walnut Creek that ranged between .5 and .72 when studied over a period of nine years.
